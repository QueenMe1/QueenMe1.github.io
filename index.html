    <h1>Susan Olayemi's Personal Website</h1>

    <h2>PURPOSE:</h2>
    <p>
      This site reflects how I learn, build, and think as a cybersecurity student with a background in software and systems.
      I'm interested in technology from end to end- designing web interfaces, writing javascript and building applications and tools in java and python,
      while understanding how systems run and stay secure. By comparing development and security, I approach problems with both creativity and technical care.
      My goal is to build software that feel intuitive, reliable and resilent. This space brings together my skills and projects as I prepare for security 
      and software enginerring internships.
