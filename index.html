      <h2>Purpose:</h2>
      <p class="p">
        This site reflects how I learn, build, and think as a cybersecurity student with a background in software and systems.
        I'm interested in technology from end to end- designing web interfaces, writing javascript and building applications and tools in java and python,
        while understanding how systems run and stay secure. By comparing development and security, I approach problems with both creativity and technical care.
        My goal is to build software that feel intuitive, reliable and resilent. This space brings together my skills and projects as I prepare for security 
        and software enginerring internships.

      <p class="p">
        I'm Susan, an honors and accelerated cybersecurity student at RIT with a builder's mindset. 
        I'm most interested in understanding how systems work end to end, 
        from how interfaces are designed to how applications run and how they are secured.
        I enjoy learning by building, breaking and improving,
        and I'm motivated by creating technology that's both reliable and human.

      <h2>Cybersecurity Focus</h2>
      <p class="p">
        My security interest are rooted in hands-on learning and practical applications.
        I've worked with security-focused tooling and environments including Nmap, Wireshark, SELinux tools,
        Sysinternals and Windows security utilities such as Group Policy and Event Viewer. I've built and secured 
        Windows and Linux virtual machines, configuring services such as web, file,email, and logging servers
        to better understand system behavior and risk.
