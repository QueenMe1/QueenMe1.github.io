      <h2>Purpose:</h2>
      <p>
        This site reflects how I learn, build, and think as a cybersecurity student with a background in software and systems.
        I'm interested in technology from end to end- designing web interfaces, writing javascript and building applications and tools in java and python,
        while understanding how systems run and stay secure. By comparing development and security, I approach problems with both creativity and technical care.
        My goal is to build software that feel intuitive, reliable and resilent. This space brings together my skills and projects as I prepare for security 
        and software enginerring internships.

      <p>
        I'm Susan, an honors and accelerated cybersecurity student at RIT with a builder's mindset. I'm most interested in understanding how systems work
        end to end, from how interfaces are designed to how applications run and how they are secured. I enjoy learning by building, breaking and improving,
        and I'm motivated by creating technology that's both reliable and human.
