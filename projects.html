                    <p class="p">
                       Choosing Web Development as a minor is something i don't regret. It enabled me to gain a strong understanding of front-end engineering 
                       and taught me to think from a user's perspective-considering what clients and users see the moment they land on a website.
                       <br>
                       This experience pushed me to thik more creatively and outside the box, ensuring that colors and fonts are not only visually appealing but 
                       also confortable and accessible to users.

                    <p class="p">
                        As part of a group project, I independently identified and analyzed four security vulnerabilities, categorizing each of them
                        by threat type and risk level. For each findings, I conducted a structured analysis including impact, likelihood, CVSS scoring, 
                        affected systems, remediation priority, and trusted NIST references to justify risk severity and response urgency.

                        enterprise environment. I focused primarily on the Windows System, with limited work in linux based exercises. 
                        Monitored system activity, reviewed firewall rules, and investigated poential security events using Wireshark, 
                        Sysinternals, Windows Event Viewer, and Powershell. Documented findings and authored incident response 
                        report and crafted execuitve summaries based on observed system behavior and security analysis

                    <p class="p">
                        Security Suite is an ongoing learning project aimed at strengthening practical cybersecurity skills
                        through Python development. The project is multi-phased, each focusing on different security concepts.
                    </p>    
                    <p class="p">
                        The first phase is a Password Strength Checker, built as a command-line python tool. It evaluates 
                        password strength based on complexity rules and uses file reading to compare user supplied passwords
                        to against a list of commonly used passwords, helping identify weak or insecure credentials. This phase 
                        emphasizes password hygiene, file handling, and defensive input validation.

                        This might be a late welcome, but WELCOME TO MY PORTFOLIO! I wanted a project that not only showcases my skills but also 
                        serves as a website to demonstrate them. Building this page from scratch has been both interesting and fun.
                    </p>
                    <p class="p">
                        The process of creating this site allowed me to research color schemes and gave me an opportunity to learn how to apply 
                        Javascript to buttons. I really enjoy the process of building things, and I see this as the beginning of my journey in creating
                        and designing projects.
